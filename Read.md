<-- # 🎵 Spotify Clone (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

This is my **first project**, where I tried to build a simple Spotify-like music player using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helped me understand how frontend technologies work together and gave me a good foundation to explore web development further.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 **Dynamic Song List**  
  Songs are loaded dynamically from a folder. Each song has:
  - An **audio file**
  - An **image/cover**
  - A **JSON file** with title and description  

  Whenever I add new songs and update the JSON, the app automatically shows them in the playlist.

- 🔑 **Multiple Pages**  
  I created 3–4 static pages to practice basic frontend navigation:
  - Login Page  
  - Signup Page  
  - Password Change Page  
  - Explorer Page
